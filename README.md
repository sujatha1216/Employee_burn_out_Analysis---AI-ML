# Employee Burnout Analysis Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Employee burnout has become a major challenge in modern workplaces, affecting productivity, mental health, and employee retention. This project focuses on **analyzing and predicting employee burnout levels** using Machine Learning techniques based on workplace and personal factors.

The goal of this project is to help organizations **identify burnout risk early** and take preventive actions to improve employee well-being and performance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Burnout among employees leads to reduced efficiency, increased absenteeism, and higher attrition rates. Traditional methods rely on surveys and manual analysis, which are time-consuming and subjective. There is a need for an **automated, data-driven approach** to predict employee burnout accurately.

---

## ✅ Objectives

* Analyze employee-related data to identify burnout patterns
* Build a machine learning model to predict burnout risk
* Compare multiple ML algorithms to achieve better accuracy
* Provide insights that help HR teams in decision-making

---
